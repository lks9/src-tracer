# Source Tracer

This is a draft of a control flow tracer based on source code instrumentation with a low overhead.
Instrument your software with `instrumenter.py`. When running instrumented software, the trace is written into a file.
The format is basically one character (plus an optional number)
for each source code block on the trace.
For accurate retracing, `replay_trace.py` uses symbolic execution.

## Which Software to Trace

Any software which is written in C, with the source code available.

## Dependencies
### For the Instrumentation

* python3
* libclang (`pip install libclang`)

### For the Trace Recording

* C compiler (or your build system at choice) to compile the instrumented software

### For the Symbolic Replayer

* C compiler (or your build system at choice) to compile the instrumented software
* python3
* [angr](https://angr.io) for symbolic execution (`pip install angr`)

## Instrumentation

1. Add to each source file
   ```C
   #include "cflow_inst.h"
   ```
2. Add macros to the respective code blocks. A list of all macros is given below.
3. Add a wrapper for the main function to call `_cflow_open` and `_cflow_close`.

For an example instrumentation, run the `instrumenter.py` on
the original `checksum.c` (instructions below).
The `instrumenter.py` also creates a list of all functions with together with their
numbers as `cflow_functions.json`.

## Trace Format

Each element consists of one capital letter + an optional hex `num` in lower case.
Elements are written sequentially without any separator.

| Macro                | Emits       | Explanation                                             |
|----------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `_FUNC(num)`         | `F` + `num` | Function call, use `num` to distinguish functions       |
| `_IF`                | `I`         | The if-branch of an if-clause is taken                  |
| `_ELSE`              | `E`         | The else-branch of an if-clause is taken                |
| `_SWITCH(num)`       | `S` + `num` | Jump to case indicated with `num` in a switch-clause    |
| `_LOOP_START(id)`    | `L`         | Beginning of a loop (for, while etc.)                   |
| `_LOOP_BODY(id)`     |             | Loop iteration, nothing is emitted                      |
| `_LOOP_END(id)`      | `P` + `num` | End of a loop, `num` indicates the number of iterations |
| `_cflow_open(fname)` |             | Initialize, write trace to file named `fname`           |
| `_cflow_close()`     |             | Close the cflow tracer                                  |

The macros are written into the source code.
An example trace is `F1EF0LP2I`, which includes sub-traces, for example `F0LP2` or `LP2`.

## Example `checksum.c`

* Copy the example directory, add `cflow_inst.h` and `cflow_inst.c`
  ```
  cp -Tr examples/ examples_inst/
  cp cflow_inst.h examples_inst/
  cp cflow_inst.c examples_inst/
  ```
* Change into the new directory
  ```
  cd examples_inst
  ```
* Instrument it
  ```
  python ../instrumenter.py checksum.c
  ```
  For a list of functions together with the numbers generated by the instrumenter,
  have a look at the newly created `cflow_functions.json`.
* Compile it (you might want different compiler optimizations for recording/replaying)
  ```
  gcc checksum.c cflow_inst.c -o checksum
  ```
* Run it (replace `42` to get another trace) 
  ```
  ./checksum 42
  ```
* Display the trace
  ```
  cat checksum.c.trace.txt
  ```
* Retrace it (use `python -i` to work with the traced `state` in the interactive shell)
  ```
  python ../replay_trace.py checksum main F1EF0LP2I
  python ../replay_trace.py checksum checksum F0LP2
  ```
  The last one just retraces function `checksum`.

## Other Software

This is the same as for the `checksum.c` example

  ```sh
  # Copy sources
  cp -Tr SRCDIR/ SRCDIR_inst/
  cp cflow_inst.h SRCDIR_inst/
  cp cflow_inst.c SRCDIR_inst/
  # Instrument
  for file in $(find SRCDIR_inst/ -name "*.c")
    do
      python instrumenter.py $file
    done
  # Now compile the sources & link them with cflow_inst.c
  
  # Run your instrumented software
  ./APP WITH ARGUMENTS
  # Display the trace
  cat APP.c.trace.txt
  # Retrace
  python replay_trace.py APP main YOUR_TRACE
  ```
