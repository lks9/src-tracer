# Source Tracer

This is a draft of a control flow tracer based on source code instrumentation with a low overhead.
Instrument your software with `instrumenter.py`. When running instrumented software, the trace is written into a file.
The format is basically one character (plus an optional number)
for each source code block on the trace.
For accurate retracing, `retrace.py` uses symbolic execution.

## Which Software to Trace

Any software which is written in C/C++, with the source code available.

## Dependencies
### For the Instrumentation

* python3
* libclang (`pip install libclang`)

### For the Trace Recording

* C compiler (or your build system at choice) to compile the instrumented software

### For the Symbolic Replayer

* C compiler (or your build system at choice) to compile the instrumented software
* python3
* [angr](https://angr.io) for symbolic execution (`pip install angr`)

## Setup

* Run make
  ```
  make
  ```
* Install the python package
  ```
  pip install .
  ```

## Example `checksum.c`

* First run the pre-processor
  ```
  cd examples/
  cpp -I../include checksum.c -o checksum_inst.c
  ```
* Instrument it (the pre-processed version)
  ```
  python ../instrumenter.py checksum_inst.c
  ```
  For a list of functions together with the `num` generated by the instrumenter,
  have a look at the newly created `functions_database.db`.
### Recording
* Compile it with `_TRACE_MODE` (you might also want different compiler optimizations for recording/replaying)
  ```
  gcc -D_TRACE_MODE -O3 -I../include -L../lib checksum_inst.c -o checksum_trace -lsrc_tracer -lpthread -lzstd
  ```
  Note: This version uses `-lpthread` and `-lzstd` for smaller traces with lower overhad.
* Run it (replace `42` to get another trace) 
  ```
  ./checksum_trace 42
  ```
  The name of the recorded trace corresponds to the current time, e.g. `2023-04-28-143402-checksum.c.trace.zst`.
* Display the trace (replace the trace name with the correct one!)
  ```
  zstd -d 2023-04-28-143402-checksum.c.trace.zst
  python ../print_trace.py 2023-04-28-143402-checksum.c.trace
  ```
### Retracing
* Compile it with `_RETRACE_MODE` (you might also want different compiler optimizations for recording/replaying)
  ```
  gcc -D_RETRACE_MODE -g -I../include -L../lib checksum_inst.c -o checksum_retrace -lsrc_tracer -lpthread -lzstd
  ```
* Retrace it (use `python -i` to work with the traced `state` in the interactive shell)
  ```
  python ../retrace.py checksum_retrace 2023-04-28-143402-checksum.c.trace
  echo "F1TTN" > sub.trace.txt
  python ../retrace.py checksum_retrace sub.trace.txt
  ```
  The last one just retraces function `checksum`.

## Other Example

An example to instrument and retrace busybox with musl-libc can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/lks9/src-tracer/wiki/Busybox-with-musl%E2%80%90libc)

## Other Software

You can do it manually as for the `checksum.c` example.

For a more automatic way that works well with make scripts, make use of `cc_wrapper/`.

### Recording
* Set some envirenmental variables. There are some variations, for example you might also add `-save-temps` to `CFLAGS`.
  ```
  export SRC_TRACER_DIR=.........
  export CC="gcc"
  export CFLAGS="-Wno-error -L${SRC_TRACER_DIR}/lib -I${SRC_TRACER_DIR}/include -no-integrated-cpp -B${SRC_TRACER_DIR}/cc_wrapper"
  export LIBS="-lsrc_tracer -lpthread -lzstd"
  export SRC_TRACER=""
  ```
* Now you can ./configure your project...
* You can copy the build directory here, if you want to reuse the configuration for retracing.
* Before the actual compilation:
  ```
  export SRC_TRACER="-D_TRACE_MODE"
  ```
* Then build your project with make, gcc, whatever

### Retracing
* Same envirenmental variables as before. Only if you want to change some variables (e.g. `CFLAGS` with `-g`) make sure
to set `SRC_TRACER=` (as empty string) before you `./configure` your project again.
* Before the actual compilation:
  ```
  export SRC_TRACER="-D_RETRACE_MODE"
  ```
* Then build your project with make, gcc, whatever

It can be a bit tricky to get the binary linking correctly,
make sure that the record/replay executable includes the record/replay
version of the app and its libraries.
